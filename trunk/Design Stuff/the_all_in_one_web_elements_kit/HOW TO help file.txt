Font used is an system font (Arial) so you dont need to worry about the font is missing.

Below please find some basic instructions on how to use your file:
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are not comfortable to work with the "the_all_in_one_PSD" file where all elements are together
in single layers, you may find to use single items much more easy. All you have to do is open the
"single item PSD files" folder and from there select the file you want to use.
---------------------------------------------------------

Editing Text Parts:

Once you have your file open in your Photoshop program, you will see the layers panel on the right
side. To edit text parts of your items (in the layers panel they use the "T" icon), you will need to first
sellect the layer you wish to edit. Then go to your tools panel located on the left side and from there
sellect the text editing tool (it uses the "T" icon). Go on the text you want to edit and click once on that
text...here you can change the text and text color to whatever you wish.


Editing color:

This file uses layer styles, so it quite easy to change the colors of your items. In the layers panel, you
wil lsee some layers uses the effect icon (is the small round icon with an "f" on it). Double click the "f"
icon and window will popup where you can see which effects are used. To edit this effects, double click
the effects that have their "checkbox" checked. Another window will popup where you can adjust/change
this effects. Make sure to save your changes before closing this popup windows, other wise the changes
you have applied wont appear.

the page where you have purchaised this item. If you are planing to use this pattern, you will need to
install it first. To instal the patter is very easy...all you have to do is, open the file in Photoshop, from the
