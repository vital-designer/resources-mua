<p>If you have ever worked with a developer or a development team, this
article will probably strike close to home. As designers, we work with
dozens of developers across the globe each year. Some of us are
fortunate enough to find a gem; a <strong>developer that just gets it</strong>.
A developer that you feel is on your same wavelength in terms of what
needs to be accomplished with the user interface, and what it needs to
happen. Most often, however, we find developers that we generally don’t
see eye to eye with. </p>

<p>This is not meant as a slam on developers, as I believe they are a

can hopefully be streamlined a bit more than it was before. </p>

<p style="clear: both;">
</p></div>
<h3>1. Provide an adequate level of documentation</h3>
<p>Modern software development methodologies may lead you to believe
that less documentation is better, however this isn’t necessarily
always the case. For starters, <strong>the best documentation that is provided is the user interface</strong>.
Not only does the UI show the developer where data should be and how it
should be formatted, but also represents the basic flow of what needs
to happen. A well thought-out and complete UI will make you a
developer’s dream colleague. Granted, there will always be developers
who don’t like everything defined and love to take liberties with your
interface. These developers are rare (and most of the time unwelcome)
in the design community.</p>
<h4>Stay ahead</h4>
<p>As a designer, you don’t need to have every single page thought out before starting development, but it is helpful to <strong>stay ahead of the developers</strong>.
Plan your features accordingly, and make sure you at least have some
type of structure (HTML, etc) ready to go when they need it. It is a
lot easier for developers to come through on a polished page and insert
data where it is needed instead of creating the page from scratch and
having the designer come in after them.</p>
<h3>2. Be decisive</h3>
<p>As designers, we make hundreds of decisions on each interface we
work on. Whether it is the height of navigation, the amount of text in
a table cell, or the alignment of text in the footer, we need to make
many decisions each and every day. This is very much like for
developers who have just as many (or more) nitpicky decisions to make
on every piece of functionality they write. But the beauty of
development is that it is less subjective than design. Sure, the
architecture, code style and language could all be subject to opinions,
but not in the way that design is subjective. Some people prefer stock
images, while others illustrations. Everyone has a favorite color,
while many colors may be perceived differently by every person.</p>
<p>As designers, we need to <strong>decide what the interface should look like</strong>.
Although some developers may enjoy tinkering with the UI, it’s not
their job; and ultimately slows them down from what they should be
doing: developing. </p>
<h4>Don’t change mid-cycle</h4>
<p>It is also important to try not to change the design while the
developers is in the middle of developing that specific feature. Agile
and Scrum methodologies insist that the developers work with the
requirements they had at the time, and in the following sprint, the
developer could revisit the feature and make modifications. As
designers, we should try to avoid any type of refactoring of the UI as
we can. It is tedious work for developers to go back and change HTML. </p>
<p><strong>Choose an HTML structure and stick to it</strong>. Try to
account for any type of design feature in your first draft of the HTML
(even if it makes your HTML seem somewhat bloated). CSS should already
control the look of your interface, so try to think of HTML as backend
code that is more difficult to change than a font color in CSS.</p>
<p>Developers don’t like refactoring their code as much as we don’t
like providing revisions to clients. Get the ‘most perfect’ result as
soon as you can.</p>
<h3>3. Communication is key, so be available</h3>
<p>You have spent countless hours mocking up the UI, polishing it to
your liking and you’re ready to hand it off to the development team.
Often times, this is where design ends and development begins. As
designers, this is where we should be <strong>most involved</strong>
to ensure that the design concept is fully realized in the working
application. Avoid just ‘throwing the design over the fence’, and
hoping the developers implement it exactly how you have envisioned it
in your mind.</p>
<h4>Stay Involved</h4>
<p>it is also important to not drop off the project here. At the least,
be available by e-mail so the developers can contact you about issues
with your designs. <strong>Respond quickly</strong> to ensure your developers are staying on track with the final product. Once again, <strong>be decisive in your communication</strong>.
Most of the time, the real data doesn’t match what you mocked up, and
there are many issues you will need to work out in conjunction with
your developer.</p>
<h3>4. Avoid feature creep</h3>
<p><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/"><img style="display: inline;" original="http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/developers-designers/gettingreal.jpg" src="How%20To%20Effectively%20Communicate%20With%20Developers_files/gettingreal.jpg" alt="Getting Real by 37signals" width="400" height="266"></a></p>
<p>The crew over at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/">37signals</a> recently wrote a book called <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>
which talks about this exact problem. This topic probably stems more
toward product managers, however it is also important for designers.
Always ask yourself, “<strong>why does this feature matter</strong>?”
Avoid a UI that is far too complex, as it only adds time on to
development, and ultimately forces you to miss deadlines. If you can’t
come up with a good reason why it should be included, then it doesn’t
need to be there. It will only slow your team down, as well as create
more for you to support.</p>
<h4>Stay Focused</h4>
<p>Focus on what is important for your users. For example, if your
users aren’t going to use invoicing heavily, or you already know better
alternatives exist in the market that you can’t beat, don’t include
them.</p>
<p>As we developed one of our recent projects, we weren’t planning on
providing a full suite of tools that included invoicing. We wanted to
concentrate on proposals, bids and RFPs; knowing that we still needed
to serve a small userbase that may require invoicing. We choose to add
in a bare-bones system (simple line items, nothing recurring), because
we felt it may be useful to some people that didn’t already have an
invoicing solution. We also realized that users probably wouldn’t want
to switch to our invoicing system (mainly because they already had a
solution), so there was no sense in creating something robust.</p>
<h3>5. Set realistic deadlines, and stick to them</h3>
<p>As designers, we can quickly turn around designs in a few days and
be done with it. Unfortunately, this is not the case for development.
The ratio of design to development hours is not even close to 1:1. <strong>Make sure your deadlines allow enough time for the developer to implement the features</strong>, as well as any back and forth time for questions.</p>
<p>No matter how hard you try to hit your deadlines, something always
comes up. Perhaps another project, kids, family, etc. Try your best not
to announce any hard dates until you are absolutely sure you will hit
them. <strong>Announce the week before</strong> (or even month before)
if you feel comfortable. If you just started a project, never commit to
launching in the next 6 months. It just won’t happen, and your users
may or may not hold you accountable for that date.</p>
<h4>Don’t make promises you can’t keep</h4>
<p>As irritating as missing deadlines is for you and your team, its
even more irritating for potential customers that are waiting for your
app to change their workflow. Be vague about deadlines, and keep people
wanting more.</p>
<h3>6. Test it yourself</h3>
<p>Don’t rely on your developers to write perfect code, as it will
never happen. You can’t always rely on developers to test their code to
make sure it functions properly, fulfills requirements and ultimately
works in the manner you described. But remember, developers don’t write
buggy code on purpose. They would rather write perfect code and work on
newer, cooler features each release. Since your developers are so close
to the code and system, they will <strong>inevitably miss something</strong>. Don’t blame them, help them fix it. Explain to them where it’s failing and what the desired action should be.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lighthouseapp.com/"><img style="display: inline;" original="http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/images/developers-designers/tickets.gif" src="How%20To%20Effectively%20Communicate%20With%20Developers_files/tickets.gif" alt="Track bugs with Lighthouse" width="277" height="76"></a></p>
<p>Also as you take on the testing, this frees up the developer to keep
moving on the back-end, which once again, is where they should be
focusing. And as you find bugs, make sure to fully document them,
including screenshots, how to recreate and most importantly, the
desired outcome.</p>
<p>Of all the developers we’ve worked with, none of them have been
interested in any type of testing past in-the-code unit testing. Large
enterprise shops higher entire Quality Assurance teams to follow-up on
developers work (which doesn’t make it right, but it’s the way it is).
Help your developers out by testing their features — your app will be
much better for it.</p>
<p>One last point is to measure performance. Set milestones and goals
and make sure you are hitting your marks. Try to monitor how your team
is doing on fixing bugs versus creating new features, as there will
always be a snowball effect. Fix bugs early and often to prevent them
from growing into larger and more complex bug colonies in the future.</p>

																<p>Yeah! Great article!! </p>
<p>However, I would like to point out that with the world being so
globalised, developers from different countries and backgrounds working
together is not surprising. Sometimes we as designers only get to work
with Project Managers who manage a group of such developers, whereby
communications become two-tier, and language barrier might be one of
the so many reason. So, just a suggestion, maybe the presence of a
Project Manager could be considered in this aspect.</p>
<p>My two cents. Cheers!</p>

							<div class="body">
																<p>I
can’t help but feel you missed a point here. How about explaining to
the developer what you want to achieve and what the goals of the
project are and have that clearly documented.</p>
<p>As per point one, personally (and for pretty much all of my
development team past and present), project specification through UI is
horrible, bits get missed, the true functionality of UI gets
misinterpreted and the developer ends up having to sit down with the UI
and derive their own specification. This then generally ends up as a
licence for overrun, scope creep and projects from hell.</p>

																<p>We
need a “How To Effectively Communicate With Designers”. Being from a
Dev background I know good developers are great a documenting and
communicating. The break down in most projects is the Customer or the
Designer. The Developers and Project Managers tend to be the only ones
that really know what is going on in my experience.</p>

																<p>As
a developer and a designer I enjoyed the post, but I think you missed
the biggest way designers can work well with developers: <strong>let the developers help solve your problems</strong>.
The goal of the design process is to create an understanding of the
product and how it will help customers. Many times engineers can help
improve the UI with a deeper understanding of what will work better or
worse with a given system.</p>
<p>Even if that doesn’t happen, developers are much better at their job
when they have a good understanding of the problem space. Don’t assume
developers won’t care about design. Every developer I know wants to
make a product that delights customers, they just need your help to see
how good design can make it happen.</p>

																<p>Interesting
post, and I feel this works both ways - developers should also
communicate to designers what is logistically possible regarding a
design. Too many times I’ve worked for agencies who present completed,
signed off designs which look utterly fabulous, but are ultimately
horrendous to build.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a dream to find a developer who is sympathetic to design,
but it’s also a dream for a developer to find a designer (and a project
manager, for that matter) who actually understands <i>how</i> a site
is built, and for them to quote a realistic timeframe to a client
(”It’ll take 3 weeks?? We’ve told them it’ll be complete by tomorrow!”)
</p>
<p>Oh, and it’s also lovely to find a designer who doesn’t insist on
presenting designs containing transparent rounded corners and gradients
everywhere. Sigh. ;-)</p>

																<p>Great
post. It just so happens that I’m being contracted to do UI design for
a Application based in Colorado (where I’m located) but the developers
are in ireland so not only time delay but just basic communication that
we want to move and style this object doesn’t mean it’s a new feature.
It’s becoming frustrating, I can’t wait until we move development to
the US. Hopefully I can apply some of what you’ve said to help me with
my communication with the devs. </p>
<p>Anyone else have any good advice?</p>

I’m lucky enough to have my “developers” about ten ft away from me and
even so, completely agree that language and communication are key to an
effective website creation.</p>
<p>I also tend to find that if your project manager/Lead Developer
comes from a programming background, the hardship is on the designer,
and vice-versa if from a designer/marketing background. If you’re lucky
enough to find somebody who is a balance of both disciplines, you’ve
found a best friend for life. A literal cat/dog life form type thing</p>

																<p>I
was just talking about this and realized that 90% of the conflicts I
have had as a developer have not come from a lack of communication from
the designer, but from the project manager. For the most part the
designers I have worked with have been very communicative, and rarely
have had an issue where the development process modified the outcome of
the project from a design perspective. Usually if I come to an
un-specified portion of the site that requires a design, we can
collaborate and create a quick wireframe and work from there. Maybe it
is also because I can’t tell a Primary Color from a hotdog, so I rarely
ever try to add new elements.</p>
<p>This article rings extremely true in my opinion however if you
replace “Designer” with “Project Manager”. The top problems I
experience evolve from scope creep, false promises to the client (”we
can do that!”), lazy timelines (not actually scheduling accurate
timelines due to putting it off until the last minute) and not
effectively communicating technical requirements to the client.</p>
<p>So as for Designers and Developers - we’re on the same side! Effective communication is all you ever need.</p>

																<p>From
a developer’s perspective, I’d add a couple of things, sort of on the
harsh-truths end of the spectrum: first, don’t condescend. Lots of
developers are major users of web applications, etc., as well as
authors of them, and have a sense of when UI doesn’t make any sense,
even if they don’t have formal design training. I can’t count the
number of times I’ve worked with “web” desigers whose background was in
print, and who insisted that they always knew better than me even
though they didn’t understand how to design for the web, because they
had the Elements of Typographic Style on their shelves (which is also
on mine, by the way). We sometimes have useful skills, too.</p>
<p>Second, play to your strengths, and to theirs. The post says to
deliver something with structure, like HTML, but often times,
designers’ strong suits are not writing good markup, and that’s
something lots of developers do really well. If you know what you’re
doing, great, but if you’re going to hand over an incomprehensible pile
of tags with IDs like “div_4,” I’ll take the layered PSDs and write my
own, thanks. It’s not something I mind: I’m the one being paid to write
the code, after all.</p>

																<p>I’m
now a freelance web designer and developer, but in my past life
(full-time job) I was primarily a developer. As others have mentioned,
the biggest difficulties for both designers and developers actually
came from product management — scope creep, unclear requirements,
endless “tweaking” requests, and unrealistic expectations. </p>
<p>I liked the emphasis on communication in this article, but I’m
picking up on a little condescension toward developers. The fact that
QA departments exist is not because developers are sloppy or lazy.
Think about it this way — if you’re writing a 100-page document, you’re
not going to hit every keystroke correctly the first time around. Some
errors you’ll catch as you make them, some you’ll catch as you read
over what you’ve written, and some you won’t notice until others point
them out (I’m sure they’re in this post!) That’s why editors and
proofreaders exist. A good coder/writer will minimize the number of
mistakes, but they happen to the best of us. And of course, if
designers/product managers/clients are hovering over your shoulder,
changing the requirements and rushing the process, the likelihood that
bugs will crop up increases exponentially.</p>
<p>Well, I’ll step off my soapbox now. :) And I do sympathize — I’ve
definitely run into developers who look down their noses at designers,
and clients who think that they can do a design job when they most
*definitely* cannot. So thanks for writing the article!</p>

																<p>My
general experience as a developer has been about 70+% of the time the
designer and/or project manager blow off or somehow hose up the
scheduled project time line (i.e., assuming they didn’t just pull it
out of their toe in the first place) and when push comes to shove the
developer has to belly up and deal with a massive work load in a short
time frame. Throw in the extra headaches of trying to figure out what
the customer “really” wants along w/ usual recipe of bogus
documentation and double talk crafted by management and the developer
is up against it almost always. The only projects where this doesn’t
happen is when I can interface with the client directly and have total
say over the specs.</p>

																<p>I think exist something very wrong about this.</p>
<p>Is with the *customer* or actual user that *both* need to talk
about. The designer is as bad as anybody on define a project of
software. The designer is not the key role (except if the website have
few soft requeriments).</p>
<p>Also, sometimes (sorry, EVERY time in my experience) a designer not
know or understand the limitations that impose the plataform where we
develop on. For example demanding that the desing of the website look
exactly as in photoshop and complaining when not.</p>
<p>I have the impresion that “designer” here is more a “software
designer” than a “graphic designer¨. A graphic designer probaly is as
bad as any other in layout a software, build the interaction rigth,
define the steps, and know what is 1, then what is 2, 3, 4…. IF
“designer” here is a software designer, then everything is ok.</p>
<p>Is very, very bad drive any kind of development from the UI. That
plague a lot of developers. Is far better drive the application from
the user expectation, requeriments, challenges, etc. </p>
<p>When somebody commit the mistake of drive development from the UI,
then is very likely that the internal desing get messy. However, when
is clear the intention and have a good understanding of the actual
process, a good UI mockup help A LOT!!!!</p>

																<p>Sorry,
this post has several flaws. I won’t go into details, but here are a
few realties of software development that you need to consider:</p>
<p> - Users want functionality, not a specific UI design. If I tell a
developer to build something based on a user interface design the
underlying functionality will be lost or misunderstood. Tell the
developer what the user wants to achieve.</p>
<p> - Requirements change. You can’t stop them from changing. The
reasons why they change include changing business environment, changes
in the organization, new insight gleaned as developers provide
incremental functionality.</p>
<p> - There are different levels/seniority of developers - you need a
mix of senior leads that can interpret requirements, and code monkeys
that can write code (to which your article seems to assume all
developers are)</p>

<p>User interface design should be done by whoever can do it best- no matter what their job title.</p>

<p>I design AND develop, and yes it is possible to do both. The problem
with developers is that everyone that is speaking to them, except for
other developers, don’t usually know how to communicate what they need
in dev lingo. A designer who only designs is pretty much worthless in

																<p>There’s UI designers, and then there’s Graphic Artists who happen to be working on a UI.</p>
<p>My experience has been that real UI designers are great to work
with, and think first in terms of solving the User’s problem, and tend
to work great with developers.</p>
<p>The graphic artist types are really defensive about any
changes/deviations from their mockups, and almost universally insist on
working up front on their own time without talking to devs at all. When
it comes time to code their masterpieces, there’s almost never enough
time to finish all the detailed bells and whistles. They also have a
really hard time differentiating the important funtionality vs the nice

																<p>I
find most if not all of this article laughable. The condescending
attitude of the author is extremely annoying. The notion that designers
are the ones who oversee and hold the developers hand through the site
development is hilarious. </p>
<p>As a developer I can honestly say that designers along with project
managers are always at the core of the problem in every site
development cycle. PMs always over promise and continuously allow for
feature creep and designers rarely if ever take into consideration the
dynamic aspects of a website. Sure you can make a page look really
pretty with a well defined set of data but designers hardly ever take
into consideration the countless possibilities of data combinations
that users actually enter. What if a someone posts a full page comment
as opposed to just three lines? What if someone uploads an image that
is in a portrait aspect ratio instead of a landscape? As a developer we
have to think about all possible ways a user could manipulate a
page…designers usually only tend to think about how they themselves
would.</p>
<p>Overall the ideas on communication are fine, but like some have said
this stuff is common sense. It’s funny though because designers hardly
ever actually do ANY of this stuff. Most of the time we get a PSD and
nothing but a “Why isn’t this finished yet?” or a “This doesn’t look
EXACTLY like the PSD”. Meanwhile the developer is the one pulling the
countless all nighters in order to hit the BS deadline that the PM
pulled out of thin air and to implement the usually poorly thought out
user flow of a site and functionality that does not yet exist except in
the labs at Google. Meanwhile the designer is home every night at a
normal hour and sleeping soundly, dreaming about the next version of
Photoshop to be released.</p>
<p>I know it’s hard for designers to put together 10 - 20 PSDs (if
that) for a site using an application that lets you draw on the screen
basically…so I empathize with you…really I do…but try stepping into my
world where you work with actual limitations. As a developer I work
with sometimes hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code in
something like 5 - 6 different programming languages. While it may be
hard for you to take that PSD and hide the layer, adjust the color hue,
move an element from left to right (etc.), in order for us to make that
change can sometimes require adjusting or rearranging countless files
and hundreds of lines of code.</p>
<p>Developers usually if not always end up holding the designer’s hand to see a site through to completion… as a necessity!</p>
<p>I have said my bit … I await the onslaught of designer comments.</p>

																<p>Heh. Check out the rage!</p>
<p>Look people, building a web application requires a large set of
skills, not a small set of people. It doesn’t matter whether the UX guy
is the developer, or the designer, only that there be someone with UX
skills. Someone has to backend code, someone has to do database work,
someone has to do admin work, deployment, testing, branding, graphic
design, scripting, html+css, security, business analysis, architecture,
etc etc.</p>
<p>In some projects, those skills mostly reside in one person. In
others, they’re diversified among most of the team. In general, the
more senior the person, the more they’re able to step up and take some
or all of the load for these skills - even if it’s not their primary
expertise.</p>
<p>As long as you’re all busy arguing about what the designers role is,
without defining which of the myriad of skills actually belong to
“designer”, you’re all just sheep passing in the night.</p>
<p>Here’s the key thing: at the beginning of any project, identify who
has what skills and to what degree. Make sure everyone knows this. Then
decide where the buck stops for each one, make sure everyone knows this
too. After that, it’s all about communication and holding people
responsible for their work. If you have html skills but it was agreed
that the designer would do the html, then that’s it, you’re not doing
HTML unless the designer asks you to. Got a problem with that? talk to
the project manager role.</p>

																<p>So to summize: the way to effectively communicate with developers is to act and work like a professional.</p>
<p>And yet it did not occur to the condescending jerk-off who wrote
this piece that it may not be the developers who are the problem when
it comes to effective co-operation…</p>
<p>To paraphrase this piece of junk: “Some of us are fortunate enough
to find a gem; a designer who actually knows what the f*** they’re
doing.” </p>
<p>It’s not a matter of not seeing eye to eye. A designer who designs
an interface for a website or any other piece of software is an
important part of the process of developing said website, not an
outside force of nature who’s only responsibility it is to be
“creative”. If you don’t grok the process of developing software, stick
to designing posters and flyers, instead of bitching about developers
who “don’t get it”.</p>
<p>Developing a website is collective effort that involves many
disciplines. There’s no room for condescending a-holes who feel just
being able to make pretty pictures, sorry, beautiful designs, puts them
outside, or god forbid, above that collective. There’s no room for solo
artists with a limited skill set in this business.</p>
<p>Now take your timemachine and travel back to 1995, when clients and designers still thought websites where glorified brochures.</p>
<p>A developer.</p>
<p>P.s.: Yes, like many developers I actually read Smashing. Wonder how many designers read sites about development…</p>

																<p>Yes,
take a look at the number of developers responding to this article. I
guarantee you, you will never get so many designers reading programming
blogs. Take this into consideration when dealing with developers.</p>
<p>Be aware that UI design is taught in most computer science courses
and is a fundamental part of any good programmer’s education. Good
developers have strong opinions and deep knowledge regarding UI design
and functionality.</p>
<p>Creative thinking is a prerequisite for good programming, and many
programmers have strong creative talents in the fields of music, art,
writing etc. If you pull that ‘we are different, we are creative’ line,
you won’t get very far with that programmer who is into photography and
plays drums on Saturday night.</p>

																<p>I
agree with “loki_racer.” This article is a little insulting. I think
that some of these subjects are a fundamental difference of how
designers and developers think - right brain vs left brain.</p>
<p>We left brain developers have a tendency to think very module,
objective, linear and logical. It’s natural for us to think about
projects in that way. The look and feel is something that’s icing on
the cake.</p>
<p>But on the flip side, for the person who’s designing, it’s usually
about colors, styles, the whole piece fitting a style that represents
the entire project, etc.</p>
<p>I haven’t worked with a designer who understood the difference. This
is just in my particular case. But on every project i’ve worked on, I
usually get comps that represent 60% of what I actually need. </p>
<p>That’s because the designer feels it’s complete, maybe because the
style is done, or they feel the design guideline is done - which can be
copied and transformed into other pieces “follow the style guide”. </p>
<p>But developers don’t have time to focus on translating a style guide
into pieces we’re building. We need stuff that’s ready to go, as is,
exactly as the designer wants it. If any “translating the styles”
happens on the developer side, it usually leads to a mess, that ends up
having to be changed.</p>
<p>The projects I’ve worked on that were really a breeze and, basically
flawless execution, were the ones that the design was done after
project specs, and UX. You have to have someone who’s logical, and
plans the user experience, and understands the user goals. After that’s
done, then the designer puts a skin on UX.</p>
<p>Again, this is just in my experiences, but often when the designer
is putting the comps together, without any UX guides, they tend to
think too much on colors, gradients, etc. This is where the problems
happen, while they’re working they’re not thinking logically about the
user.</p>
<p>I gotta say, there are some great designers out there. And sometimes
I wish I was a better designer. But then I just remember - that’s why I
love code so much more. It’s what I love. </p>
<p>Maybe one day we’ll all be friends</p>
<p>This article, like so many others was pretty weak. Isn’t “communication” taught in like first grade?</p>

																<p>Where
is the Interactive Creative Director / Art Director in this? That’s
what they are there for you know - they can code and design, and should
be over the back of the designer letting them know when their design is
going to break interface, and making sure the devs, who can’t tell blue
from pink, are never making a design decision. PM’s sometimes can fill
this role, but I find CD’s are much more capable of making sure the
designs are right for dev, and in my firm, the PM doesn’t have to do
anything but manage time and budget, I manage the people and production.</p>

interface - its not their job to design! They dev what they are told to

<p>Most devs can take a psd and make a site out of it exactly how it
was designed. Its when the interface doesn’t take into account real
world functionality that there is trouble. Its on the designers
shoulders to make sure this doesn’t happen. </p>
<p>Im an ICD, and I can tell you most designers don’t know crap about
web. They just don’t think that way, because most are illustrators or
print designers who have to get into web to have a job. I require that
if you work for me in web you have to learn code, period. I had to when
I wanted to get into web.</p>
<p>I find that the leg work is done up front in design, and usually
goes smoothly from there. It is vital that the person managing the
Designers be both an excellent designer and Dev. Devs are not difficult
to work with, on the contrary, Designers - pure Designers - are the
most difficult employees in the office, hands down. Ask anybody in a
firm.</p>

																<p>Hilarious
the reaction by a few developers here. This piece was so not offensive
if you would have actually read it and got your ego’s out of the way.
Sure, you can probably do a lot more than code, but that isn’t what
this article was about. And if you wanted to do more than code, there
was also a section about communication and answer questions. I would
assume this is where you could have your feedback.</p>
<p>As a developer, we all have egos that we need to get over. It’s
funny to hear everyone say “people don’t know how to talk to devs”.
Look who is condescending now @loki_racer and @rick. It’s a good thing
you guys know everything so you don’t need designers, but I certainly
do. </p>
<p>Since you think you are smarter, write your own article and submit how it should really be done.’<br>
Thanks for the article!</p>

never said what developers do is anymore important than what designers

<p>How is me asking designers to understand a little about development
condescending? I’d love to hear the logic behind that. A designer that
lives in a box of simply pumping out designs and doesn’t have a clue or
care about learning a little development isn’t going to make it far in
the industry. I consider photoshop just another tool in my toolbox of
apps. By asking designers to understand how to use nusphere, zend IDE,
etc. I’m actually asking them to do a little professional skill
development.</p>
<p>When did I say anything about first grade?  Have you ever actually had a real debate?</p>
<p>I’m sure your response will have some very random points to be made,
but I’m done arguing. I made my point in my first comment. You just
didn’t like the points I made and decided to try and put words in my
mouth.</p>

																<p>Nice article, at least most parts but it’s a shame that developers (or are they?) started to storm out already.</p>
<p>I’m working for a web 2.0 project with a desktop application. We are
building our website and application multi-language and client based
(changeable colours and images). As a UI Designer and Graphic Artist, I
also tried to learn basic coding. I always ask developers what they are
using? How do they do some features so I get the feeling. I send PSD,
CSS and sliced images when I’m working on something to developers.</p>
<p>Since 99, I’ve worked with a lot of developers and most of them were
like stubborn child. They are not open to listening designers who might
know better than them when the subject is design! System is based on
developers working on coding, sure there are guys who understand the
importance of design but most of them don’t! And they shouldn’t! All
They have to know is how make it. Most of the time, Boss/Project Manger
tells me that developers complain about my designs because they are not
possible to do but they are! I don’t design something before trying to
code it!</p>
<p>A good designer never make a design which is not possible to code.
If you are claiming so, you didn’t work with a good designer! That is
it!</p>

																<p>Interesting. I also agree with some of the other comments that this is common sense. </p>
<p>That said, IMHO this makes a case of havinng the developer(s)
involved earlier in the design / project process. They are where the
rubber is meeting the road. The more holistic their understanding is
the more likely they are to make architecture and coding decisions that
are more flexible and in tune with the possible evolution of the end
client’s biz needs.<br>
Designer’s design but it’s the developer who’s bringing the biz rules
to life. With all due respect many designers don’t seem to have the
necessary biz chops.</p>
<p>In short, there’s nothing to be gained from keeping the developers in the dark to the end.  </p>
<p>IMHO, of course ;)</p>

somehow took over my electronic life. i think that the small design
background helps me out with my development a lot, and i would suggest
for all developers to experiment with design, and read a lot about good

																<p>The
business of developing websites is getting increasingly more
professional as sites become more complex and clients demand real
results. </p>
<p>In my experience, the designers that display the kind of attitude as
the author and some of the commenters are slowly but surely becoming a
dying, are rather soon-to-be-unemployed breed. (And yes, the same goes
for the kind of autistic codemonkeys the author seems to believe all
developers are. Like some designers should go back to designing print,
those kind of developers should go back to coding enterprise software
in some IT department.)</p>
<p>Luckily that still leaves plenty of talented, professional designers
and developers that do “get it”, that understand that great user
experiences can only be created if many disciplines (”designers” and
“developers” are a btw ridiculous simplification of the many skills
involved in building a website) work together towards a single goal.</p>
<p>And working together, respectfully and professionally, is almost the
opposite of what this article is portraying. Good designers should be
just as offended by this article as some developers are.</p>

maybe the Project Manager, Designer and the Developer should sit down
and chat about possible solutions for the specific project before the
designer whips up anything or the project manager tells the client any
ETA. that would just make since and is the only way i will participate
in any project. to have the designer come up with a design to solve the
customer’s problem with out first researching and speaking to the
developer is nonsense. Any good developer should have a wealth of
knowledge about the limitations and the end user experience, to not
take advantage of that is disrespectful to both the client and the
developer. I’ve worn both shoes, and can empathize with both sides, but
even more than communication, i think all the “team” members need to be
on the same page from the second the project begins.</p>

I found this to be a good article, it is very Web app or simple 2-tier
client server oriented. When designing a complex n-tier enterprise app
the UI is just not that critical as an initial design document or even
a guide. You can have a great design for the UI, but in n-tier its
doesn’t tell you all that much about what has to be done in the back
end (other than what data ultimately gets published to the UI). Even
with a great UI, you can still royally screw up the back end in a
n-tier app and end up with a total piece of crap.</p>

a flame war. I’ve worn both hats, and managed projects for 5 years

two words or less:.: “Be specific.”, or “Communicate.”.</p>
<p>If someone involved in the design or development of the web site
didnt do what I asked for, and (as the customer) it was dellivered to
me, I’d question the communications skills of ALL of the people in the
company. As a former owner of a web company, remember that the customer
sees One face - the web company. When either ’side’, designer or
developer, bickers or rants, it makes the whole team look bad. And as
the guy paying for it, I just don’t care. Just suck it up and
communicate. That’s the objective of a web site, right?</p>

																<p>Blaming
developers or designers for projects gone wrong is pointless. I happen
to sit on the developer side of the fence, but the key to all
successful projects is simply good communication. People are not mind
readers. I personally have little fear of my job being outsourced
because I have worked with developers in non English-speaking countries
and the upfront savings are almost always canceled out by costly
miscommunication, even when the workers have good intentions and are
excellent technical coders. Tip: if your developer can’t carry on a
short conversation about the weather he probably won’t understand and
correctly implement your 45 page specifications doc. </p>
<p>Designers: be very specific in your designs, and remember that not
only must you provide a static pretty picture, but you must also
communicate the flow and usability of a website and consider different
scenarios. What if the title is two lines long? What if this page
doesn’t happen to have a photo like the one shown in your mock-up? When
a form is submitted incorrectly, where will the error mesages appear?
And so on. </p>
<p>Developers: be very detailed upfront about what you are going to
implement. Put everything down in writing or email first. Ask for
wireframes before final designs. Clarify any and all gray areas before
you write a line of code. Re-work and re-coding is frustrating for
everyone. </p>
<p>Most of all, when you’re not sure don’t assume… ask! The development
process needs to be one of collaboration from start to finish.</p>

																<p>As
someone who works in a large Enterprise operation (one that has an
aforementioned QA team), I can tell you that as a site or software
becomes more complex that the it’s often the designer who has not
considered all the cases in a scenario (boundary cases, error handling,
etc.). In the worst case, where there’s no time to rethink a design
(and make more changes), it’s up to the developer to fill in the gaps
with the current structure.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with bringing the developer and designer together
at an early phase to make sure goals are aligned. Instead of playing
the blame game at late stages in a project, the designers and
developers should be working with each other to overcome issues. If the
designer is able to rationalize and justify (”sell”) features and
changes to developers up front, I believe they will have more
cooperation in the long term.</p>

																<p>Well,
what is a developer? Seems like many of the design folks here, worked
with developers that got educated by reading blog posts. Get yourself
an certified Software Engineer and you will be happy ever after. </p>
<p>I agree to Mike Palmer. Developers often need to fill the gaps,
because most designer’s work end with one or two PSD files while the
final web application may consist of hundreds of views in different
states (user logged in / user logged out / etc.). </p>
<p>In many projects time is a valuable resource. So most of the time,
the developers need to start coding before the final design is ready.
The developers construct their system to meet the functional
requirements as well as the non-functional ones like response time. So
when the design is ready many development decisions are already made
and thus there are technical constrainst that need to be taken care of
in the design</p>

																<p>I’ve
done both designing and developing. I’d rather just do them both myself
so there’s no miscommunication. Haha. I agree with the previous
comment, though. I would say those are also issues clients would need
to be aware of too. Don’t change mid-cycle. Especially when the concept
and mockups explained very thoroughly what’s going to be done and the
stamp of approval was given… Just to change it. UGH.</p>
<p>Designers and developers–get over yourselves! I feel like the people
bashing each other and the article are all people who probably need to
understand this article the most and missed the point. Learn to
communicate, some people just don’t have the brain functionality to do
both, which is why we need each other as well as others to help foresee
projects to completion. Having been on both sides, there’s no need to
be offended. Some developers really just don’t get it and some
designers really have no idea either. That’s why I don’t understand why
there isn’t more “forced” or “required” (for lack of a better word)
interaction between the two (ESPECIALLY in the early stages) in some
businesses/agencies or even in educational institutions. It’s pretty
absurd.</p>

is very important for a designer to work at least one entire project
life cycle to understand his job better. Else he would think he plays
the most important part in the project. once you know what developers
do with your HTML, you know how important it is to write clean code. A
UI designer who knows how things work in backend can create better
stuff. Many are just graphic designers with little understanding about
coding and user experience. Similarly most developers and project
managers ignore users. They think only functionality. How users
interact with the system is most important. It takes time for designer

that was all of the input I’d get. I may get a paragraph or two in the
email outlining basic things like rollover colours or what not, but for
the most part I was on my own. What was so frustrating was he’d want
complex work done neglect to tell me (this is why I’ve dropped him) and
then proceed to make me feel like a bad developer because he either
didn’t state what he wanted or had a warped sense of how the web worked.</p>
<p>I LOVE it when I get as much information as possible because the

there’s very little information projects change mid-stream and there’s
nothing that can be done with it.</p>

																<p>Working
in big software development project as an user experience designer
&amp; interaction designer it is really interesting for me to see on a
daily basis how big cultural differences are between developers and
designers.<br>
I am glad to have an educational background in interection design which
among a lot of other (theoretical) education considered the formal and
emotional aspects of visual design, the structural aspect of writing
object oriented code and the experience a user may have tested through
rapidly created prototypes.</p>
<p>Still a lot of developers think of the designer role as the one who
pushes pixels in Photoshop while a lot of designers seem to feel secure
in this role and don’t take responsibility in creating an user
experience which is more than the static expression of a PSD file could
express.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When a product hits the market in the end neither the developer nor the
designer are going to be the daily user of their product.<br>
In the developement process the creation of personas, scenarios and use
cases helps creating prototypes which need to have a certain detail of
viusal design and logic to mimic the function to be tested with the
real users.</p>
<p>In the end a developer doesn’t like to be told wether to use an “if
or while loop” as a visual designer won’t appreciate when his colors,
type and layout gets changed. Roles have to be clear to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 2 cents,<br>

worked with the same amount who you cant do this with. I have given
PSDs to devs and come back to see incorrect fonts, colors, sizes,
measurments - nothing what looks like the design I handed them. Ive
literally had to sit down and walk them through it. I found the best
solution to this is to write out every font name, size, hex code and
measurement. Its very tedious - but so far they LOVE that I give them
all this information, and we usually get a close to perfect outcome.</p>

																<p>If
you cant communicate with a developer, you shouldn’t be designer,
because you were never a developer, and I find the whole intro
offensive.</p>
<p>I guess I dont “get it”.  </p>
<p>Im not a religious man, but “dont throw your pearls to swine” is in
my vocabulary. And that usually applies when Im talking to wanna be
designers.</p>
<p>Never seen a designer.  Only someone who has been promoted beyond coding.  Too bad.</p>

																<p>What’s
amazing to me is the he-said-she-said attitude between a lot of the
designers and developers on here. Until designers and developers can
break down those barriers and actually begin working <strong>together</strong>
these problems are going to continue. Everybody should be working
together through the entirety of a project, not just completing their
part and then passing it off to someone else.</p>
